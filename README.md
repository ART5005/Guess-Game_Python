# Guess-Game_Python
A person is playing a guessing game in which they have 3 guesses to figure out the computer’s 
secret number which will be between 1 and 20 inclusive (use randint to generate the number).
• If they guess the number correctly on the first guess the program should stop making 
them guess and they should get 10 points. 
• If they guess the number correctly on the second guess the program should stop making 
them guess and they should get 5 points.
• If they guess the number correctly on the third guess, they should get 1 point. 
After an incorrect guess tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.
If they fail to get the number correct after 3 guesses they get 0 points. Be sure to tell them what 
score they got, and show the computer’s secret number. 
Ask the user if they want to continue playing the game. If they choose to play again, start at the 
beginning.
